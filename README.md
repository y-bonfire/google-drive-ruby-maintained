This is a Ruby library to read/write files/spreadsheets in Google Drive/Docs.

NOTE: This is NOT a library to create Google Drive App.

## Introduction
‚ö†Ô∏èThis is an unofficial maintained fork of [gimite/google-drive-ruby](https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby), originally created by Hiroshi Ichikawa.

We focus on preserving compatibility and fixing bugs, with minimal disruptive changes.
New features may be added carefully when justified, but the core behavior will remain stable.

See [this issue](https://github.com/y-bonfire/google-drive-ruby-maintained/issues/7) for background and intent.

‚úÖ GitHub Actions Integration
We've started testing this library with GitHub Actions:
üëâ [CI Workflow Link](https://github.com/y-bonfire/google-drive-ruby-maintained/actions)

This enables automated testing on every push and pull request, helping ensure long-term reliability.
We welcome feedback and contributions to improve the CI process or test coverage. ü§ó

### Example to read/write files in Google Drive

```ruby
require "google_drive"

# Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
# first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
# See this document to learn how to create config.json:
# https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md
session = GoogleDrive::Session.from_config("config.json")

# Gets list of remote files.
session.files.each do |file|
  p file.title
end

# Uploads a local file.
session.upload_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt", "hello.txt", convert: false)

# Downloads to a local file.
file = session.file_by_title("hello.txt")
file.download_to_file("/path/to/hello.txt")

# Updates content of the remote file.
file.update_from_file("/path/to/hello.txt")
```

### Example to read/write spreadsheets

```ruby
require "google_drive"

# Creates a session. This will prompt the credential via command line for the
# first time and save it to config.json file for later usages.
# See this document to learn how to create config.json:
# https://github.com/gimite/google-drive-ruby/blob/master/doc/authorization.md
session = GoogleDrive::Session.from_config("config.json")

# First worksheet of
# https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg
# Or https://docs.google.com/a/someone.com/spreadsheets/d/pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg/edit?usp=drive_web
ws = session.spreadsheet_by_key("pz7XtlQC-PYx-jrVMJErTcg").worksheets[0]

# Gets content of A2 cell.
p ws[2, 1]  #==> "hoge"

# Changes content of cells.
# Changes are not sent to the server until you call ws.save().
ws[2, 1] = "foo"
ws[2, 2] = "bar"
ws.save

# Dumps all cells.
(1..ws.num_rows).each do |row|
  (1..ws.num_cols).each do |col|
    p ws[row, col]
  end
end

# Yet another way to do so.
p ws.rows  #==> [["fuga", ""], ["foo", "bar]]

# Reloads the worksheet to get changes by other clients.
ws.reload
```
